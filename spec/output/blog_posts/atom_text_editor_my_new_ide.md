      When
      I first learned Python I spent a lot of time in interactive mode:
      And
      when I finally started using Gedit, the syntax highlighting and bracket completion felt luxurious.
      But
      the time has come for a proper IDE.  I can't justify shelling out $200 for RubyMine just yet, but Atom 1.11.2 looks very promising.Of course, I could learn to use Emacs or Vim, but that's probably a bit too far for me at this
      stage.  I'd like to get there one day though.
